# BACKEND
pip3 install Flask -> NEEDED
    Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. 
    It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular
    tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation,
    or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide 
    common functions. 

pip install Flask-Cors
